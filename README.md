# Full Stack Open 2025 – Part 3 Submission

This repository contains my solutions for **Part 3** (Programming a server with NodeJS and Express) of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course offered by the University of Helsinki.

## ✅ Completed Exercises

I have completed and submitted exercises **3.1 to 3.22 (except 3.19 and 3.20)**.  
Each exercise builds upon the previous one and is organized within a unified backend project structure using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## 📁 Folder Structure

All the exercises are organized under a common project directory (e.g. `part3/phonebook-backend`) to reflect the progressive development of a RESTful API with persistent data.

Example folder layout:

<pre><code> 
part3/
├── phonebook-backend/
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── models/
│   ├── .env
│   └── ...
</code></pre>

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

To run the backend server:

1. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd part3/phonebook-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Make sure you have a `.env` file with the correct MongoDB URI and port configuration.

## 📦 Phonebook Backend (Part 3.10)

This is the backend of the Phonebook application, implemented using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It exposes a RESTful API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting phonebook entries.

### 🌐 Deployed Backend URL

You can use tools like Postman, Thunder Client, or your browser to interact with the API.
